Simply put this is a script to let you regenerate via WP-CLI all the PNG files uploaded after a certain date so that you can clean out a known PNG issue. This worked for me fine. YMMV. No warranty!

I generated it using some AI gizmos so I figured best to make it available to all of you.

# Note

You should change the table name from `FROM wp_posts` as needed.
